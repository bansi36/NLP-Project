## NLP-Project
- Text Summarization using the TextRank Algorithm with Python implementation
### TextRank is an extractive and unsupervised text summarization technique.
- Letâ€™s understand the TextRank algorithm,

--> In place of web pages, we use sentences
--> Similarity between any two sentences is used as an equivalent to the web page transition probability
--> The similarity scores are stored in a square matrix, similar to the matrix M used for PageRank
